    "We need to analyze the A/B test data from the popular game Cookie Cats. This is a classic “match-three” puzzle game where players must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win a level. The board also features singing cats :)\n",
    "\n",
    "During gameplay, players encounter gates that require them to wait for a certain time before progressing or making an in-app purchase. In this task, we will analyze the results of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. Specifically, we aim to assess the impact on player retention. In other words, we want to understand whether moving the gate 10 levels later affects when players stop playing the game, measured by the number of days since they installed it.\n",

    "We will work with data from the cookie_cats.csv file. The variables in the dataset are as follows:\n",
    "\t•\tuserid: A unique identifier for each player.\n",
    "\t•\tversion: Indicates whether the player was in the control group (gate_30 - gate at level 30) or the test group (gate_40 - gate at level 40).\n",
    "\t•\tsum_gamerounds: The number of game rounds played by the player during the first week after installation.\n",
    "\t•\tretention_1: Whether the player returned to play the game one day after installation.\n",

This means we can reject the null hypothesis (which states that there is no difference in user retention between the two groups). Yes, there is a statistically significant difference in user behavior between the two versions of the game. The two confidence intervals partially overlap, as the lower bound of the gate_40 group (0.186) is only slightly above the upper bound of the gate_30 group (0.187). This suggests that, while there is some probability that the average retention rates in these groups might be similar, the intervals overall indicate that the gate_40 group has a higher retention rate.
